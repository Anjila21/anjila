### What actually is this HACKATHON thing?
Hackathons, also known as 'Codefests,' are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, but in Nepal, they're a relatively new concept. Contrary to the misconception that hackathons involve hacking into software or security systems, they're creative events where programmers, developers, and innovative minds collaborate to solve specific problems within a set timeframe.

Hackathons, derived from 'hacker' (clever programmer) and 'marathon' (endurance), were introduced by the open-source community. These events challenge participants to work continuously on a single project for either 24 or 48 hours, aiming to develop a software prototype that addresses a predefined issue.

### WHY participate??
The primary objective is to provide a platform for creative minds to showcase problem-solving ideas using technology in real-world scenarios. Organizers present a problem, participants brainstorm, code, and develop solutions. Judges evaluate and select winners based on concepts and prototypes.

Participating in a hackathon offers numerous benefits: skill demonstration, teamwork, personal growth, leadership development, networking, innovation, and problem-solving. It's an opportunity to learn, expand knowledge, enhance portfolios, and prepare for future challenges.
