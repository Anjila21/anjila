Codefest 2022, organized by Code for Change, is the first and the biggest
Hackathon in Nepal, which intends to build a technological solution for any of the
selected 7 SDGs viz. SDG 3,4,5,9,11,13, and 16, by the students pursuing
bachelors in technology in Nepal.
It is a dynamic event in which students who are highly interested in IT can learn
new concepts, discover new ideas, and garner knowledge in the domain of
technology which will help them boost their interest and confidence in
technology and help them shape their future in this exciting field.
The event reached the students of all 7 provinces and provided them with an
opportunity and platform to pitch their idea in relation to solving any of the
proposed SDGs.



This event was a non-commercial, sponsor-funded, and unbiased common
ground for the tech enthusiast students. The event was powered by Jyoti Bikas
Bank Limited and Genese Academy Pvt. Ltd., co-sponsored by Orchid Intl
College, Dented Code Academy, and Sagarmatha College of Science and
Technology, and supported by Texas Intl College as an Education partner.

## CODEFEST 2023
{{< blogsection image="images/blog/CFC/codefest_feature.jpg" >}}

We had the idea of conducting this event nation-wide, but we could not do it all ourselves. With the help of all of our sponsors and partners, we have been able to successfully execute thi event. We also saw that we were able to create the impact that we wanted to create among the tech pursuing students and steered their ideas towards proper guidance and platfroms. This event has made us realize that it is very necessary to conduct events like this to create an impact in the tech community. The success of this event has motivated us to conduct this event in even a bigger and better way the next time.
